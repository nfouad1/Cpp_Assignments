Build d1
------------------
static linking and dynamic linking. The different between them is that static lining is copying and mering the source code and library files and creates the executable.
The Dynamic linking is done in runtime, and only have the reference of the library files. So no need to recomplie and relinking.

Overview:
(module.c/.h)->Preprocessor (module.pre) - >Compiler (module.obj) -> Linker -> .exe

Name Mangling: the compiler is giving any funtion another name. Is this the reason function overloading is not possible in C, but possible in C++.

extern keyowrd: used to see external function(cpp) in other function (cpp).Changing the scope for variables/functions.

Gtest
.....
Framework for test
Have a main value that runs all the test and returns the value.

-l linker to gtest. 


non fatial assert: Expect_EQ
fatal asser: Assert_true

Assert_STREQ : when used with pointers it checkes with dereferencing .

Predicate: 


Test stund: not using the real stuff.
