Containers:
different between vector and deque[dek] is that the deque can expand the list in both direction.

Associative container:
Set() is an important
Set() does not have indexed elements.


When using lower and upper bound in Set(), make sure to know that the value you are searching for exist ontherwise user an if statement to check the return values.


Maps:
Stores the value in a map fasion.
Maps defined like pair with a key and a value. the pair is an object.  the pair can be called throught the object pointer( ->).


fstream:
Ofstream - read from file
ifstrem - write to file
fstream - both read and write

Embeded concepts

Preprocessor directives:
preprocessing (modifies the original program according to the directive that starts with '#') --> compilation(translate the prrogram infor a object file) --> linking (handles merging and make executable file.)

macros (are any text replacements) eg. #define arr_size 5  or functions getmax(a,b) (if statement)
Are used to save memory and if the arr is used alot in the code.
macros are not recommenced to defualt debugging.

inline function is a realfunction which is also a text replacement, so the variable are not store in the memory.
it has the merit of macros and a merit of a normal function so the compiler with check for the types.


#Pragma
used to turn of the optimizer, start or end function before main.
It depends on the complier.

Polling vs Interrupt
polling is just wainting until getting the result. not used alot.
Interrip are used more.

Reentrant:
A function that does not used any global variable to be safe.
Can not be interupted.

Synchornous function and Asynchronous functions

Callback functions:
I give you a pointer to call be again.
The the function call the other funtion and give the adress of the function.
Callout is the normal function call
