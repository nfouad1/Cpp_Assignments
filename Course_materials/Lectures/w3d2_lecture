Templates;

Templates provides developers with the opprtunity of implemeting algorithms or defininf objects in classes independent of data types.
Two types of templates: Functions and Class
Purpose is to pass different data type to functions.


Template classes:

main difference betwene class and typename is telling that I will use more space due to that I can pass array not only on variable.
if a function or a class uses one tmpelate variable then the fucntoion/class is considered as a template function/class

The number of argumetns input is the desicion if template should be used or function overloading should be used.
function overload allows you to pass different arguments while template need to have the same arguments nr.


Vectors:
Vector itself is a template. 
takes alot of memory.
Vectors are stored in stack but the elements are stored in the heap.

differens between Sets and vectors: Sets can sort, abaility to remove dublicates .

all iterators are pointers ex. s1.begin() will return to you a pointer.
conditionary itary statement: return a>b ? true : false; (its an if sats in oneline)
